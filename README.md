# Live wallpaper Engine for Linux
A simple script that allows you to play a GIF, video, or image sequence on your desktop wallpaper!

__Make sure you have these programs installed:__
- python
- python3
- ffmpeg
- imagemagick
#### Note
I highly recommend using the `performance` CPU governor, or the desktop may lag.
You can change the governor by using:
```bash
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
